- New shortcuts for F-Keys so you can have easy access for important shotcuts on these keys.
- The nodes functions that where in F-Keys now are in a mode called Nodes and Scopes, that will have all the node shortcuts and selection of the Scopes.

Tips about Tangent Wave Booster:
- 1 - When setting a knob intensity on Tangent Mapper, use for the OSC Value format the option Interger and the knob sensitivity at Coarse. For the Min and Max values, use 0 to 5 if you want not too fast repeating. 0 to 6 for a little more. 0 to 10 and 0 to 50 will give you a fast response with a more sensible knob so only use this for things that doesn't matter repeat the same command more than one time. Example: For select all clips, you can repeat the command because doesn't matter, will select all and that's it. So you can use 0 to 50 because will give you a sensible and fast response. Although for delete you don't wanna the delete being pressed a lot of times in a row, so use 0 to 5.

- 2 - When creating a new resolution/dpi scale setup, you have to create the hashs for the dots on curves panels. For this use the FindText class, run it using AHK than:
- 2.1 - Open the custom_curves_hash.ini and create a new field with the same name of your resolution/dpi Scale scheme (just copy/paste one that is already in the document and change the name of the resolution inside the []) - Before you continue, check if it's working for your resolution tha same hashs that already exist in the file, you can try copy different resolutions and see if one of them already work for your resolution. If not, than proceed to create your own hashes;
- 2.2 - For each type of dot, you have one hash. One for the Dot in ALL/Y modes, one for any dot selected, one for the dot in each color mode RGB. Total of 5 hashs for each resolution. You have to create one of each for your new resolution/dpi scale scheme;
- 2.3 - To create each hash, start running the class FindText.ahk;
- 2.4 - Click on capture;
- 2.5 - Select the dot on the screen (inside the red/blue rectagle);
- 2.6 - On the captured image, cut the edges to keep just the dot;
- 2.7 - Use COLOR mode to select the gray part of the dot;
- 2.8 - Click on the center of the dot image to select the color;
- 2.9 - Click on COLOR2TWO Button;
- 2.10 - Click on Ok Button;
- 2.11 - Copy the on TEXT propertie to the custom_curves_hashs.ini respective hash place;
- 2.12 - Repeat the process from 2.4 to 2.11 for each type of dot.

3 - When creating a new position variable, remember to add it on res_dpi_scale_variables.ini file too.
