Tangent Booster 2

A software that will give to your Tangent Panels incredible powers to control Davinci Resolve! It can be used too with any MIDI Controller that has a Mapping Software with OSC support. Last but not least, it can be used with other softwares than Davinci Resolve, but you need to setup positions for each thing.
