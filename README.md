This is a project created and developed by Andr√© Rodrigues, a Colorist from Brazil.

I started this project for my personal use in 2020, and for a while it was sold for people around the world that was interested in use it. The project was used for people from lots of countries in the world, even people in Hollywood.

This was made in AHK, using OSC to do the communication between Control Booster and Tangent Mapper on Windows. But it can be used in any other mappers / panels that has support for OSC communication. So, you can use it for example with TouchOSC and similar softwares instead Tangent Mapper.

Also, I started the Mac Version, which is in very early state, but it already has the OSC Communication working, you can move mouse, click and etc. It just need create the functions now. As the same on windows, you can use it with Tangent Mapper or any other panel and/or software that has support for OSC communication.

The possibilities are infinite and you can control any software using Control Booster and some knowledge about OSC and any other script language. You can mix it with controllers, panels, softwares, apps and script languages to create a new tool that will control any software on Mac or Windows.

TODAY, June 18 2024, I'll open the code for anyone who wants use it. You can change the code as you need, use part of it in other projects (including paid ones) and anything else, since you put my name and the name of the project (Control Booster) in the credits.

I'll not give any support about this software anymore in any situation.
