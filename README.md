This is a project created and developed by Andr√© Rodrigues, a Colorist from Brazil.

I started this project for my personal use in 2020, and for a while it was sold for people around the world that was interested in use it. The project was used for people from lots of countries in the world, even people in Hollywood.

This was made in AHK, using OSC to do the communication between Control Booster and Tangent Mapper on Windows. But it can be used in any other mappers / panels that has support for OSC communication. So, you can use it for example with TouchOSC and similar softwares instead Tangent Mapper.

Also, I started the Mac Version using Hammerspoon and Lua Script, which is in very early state, but it already has the OSC Communication working, you can move mouse, click and etc. It just need create the functions now. As the same on windows, you can use it with Tangent Mapper or any other panel and/or software that has support for OSC communication.

The possibilities are infinite and you can control any software using Control Booster and some knowledge about OSC and any other script language. You can mix it with controllers, panels, softwares, apps and script languages to create a new tool that will control any software on Mac or Windows.

- You can find the final stable version of the software to be used on Windows here:

- You can find the code of the final stable version of the software for Windows here:

https://github.com/FoxDanger/Control-Booster-OpenSourceCode/tree/master/develop/davinci_resolve/tangent_panels/control_booster_2.8

- You can find the initial version of Mac OS here (you need use it with Hammerspoon - just make this your init.lua on hammerspoon):

There's more files in the folders, some other tools, there's a begin of a auto-configuration tool that find itens in the screen and some other stuffs in the folders.

This software/code can be combined with lots of different tools, scripts and other softwares, and can be very powerful. And it has some resources that can be useful, like the tool to control all the curves panel on Davinci Resolve, that works nice and better than ANY other tool in the market. Even Blackmagic Panels doesn't work so well with curves like Control Booster. And using the code that is used to control the curves panel, you can create some other miracles and control other stuffs on the screen in any software.

TODAY, June 18 2024, I'll open the code for anyone who wants use it. You can change the code as you need, use part of it in other projects (including paid ones) and anything else, since you put my name and the name of the project (Control Booster) in the credits.

I'll not give any support about this software anymore in any situation.
